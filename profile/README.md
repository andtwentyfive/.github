# Built with care. Guided by people.

At AND25, we believe software development is, at its heart, an act of service. Our job is not just to build things right - but to build the right things for the people who use them.

## 1. People Over Products

We create software to support people's goals, not to showcase our own skills. Our customers' needs, challenges, and feedback guide what we build and why.

> We listen before we build.

⸻

## 2. Understanding Over Assumptions

We work to understand the context, constraints, and lived realities of those we serve. We ask questions, seek out diverse voices, and remain open to being wrong.

> Good ideas come from empathy, not ego.

⸻

## 3. Long-Term Relationships Over Short-Term Wins

We value trust more than transactions. We measure our success by the lasting impact we make, not just by how quickly we deliver or how flashy our features are.

> Reliability earns more loyalty than speed.

⸻

## 4. Clarity Over Complexity

We strive for simplicity and transparency in both our code and communication. We don't build to impress - we build to be understood, used, and trusted.

> If it confuses the customer, it's not done yet.

⸻

## 5. Collaboration Over Control

We don't pretend to have all the answers. We involve customers early and often, learn together, and adjust our direction as new insights emerge.

> We do better work when we don't work alone.

⸻

## 6. Learning Over Certainty

We view every project as an opportunity to grow. Mistakes are part of the process. Listening, reflecting, and improving matter more than always being right.

> We stay curious - and humble - at every stage.
